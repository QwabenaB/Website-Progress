<h1 id="h">JOLLOF RICE RECIPE<h1>

 <div class="intro">
<p class="int1">No habanero, so substituted three Thai chili peppers. Still spicy and delicious. The puréed onions turned my kitchen into a tear inducing war zone. I was forced to go find clear glasses to finish browning the onion. I would do it all over again as it came out so good! Gonna invest in some safety goggles for the next time lol</p>
<p class="int2">I'm from Nigeria, and we make this as well. To prevent your rice from being mushy, boil it separately first but halfway... don’t cook it to the fullest. Then, after mixing the tomato paste and ingredients in a pot to boil, you can add the half boiled rice to fully boil. Your rice will turn out perfect. It’s best you use parboiled rice not jasmine rice.</p>

<h1 class="stp">STEPS</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
    <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
